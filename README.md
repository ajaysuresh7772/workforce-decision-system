# Workforce Scheduling Optimisation

This project analyses how workforce scheduling decisions affect labour cost, compliance, and service quality.

It uses:
- Fishbone (Ishikawa) analysis
- Business impact quantification
- Confidence-score-based optimisation logic

The goal is to demonstrate how complex operational decisions can be structured using data-driven frameworks.
